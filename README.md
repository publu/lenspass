Deployed across Chiliz, Scroll, Mantle, and Linea networks, our system leverages the unique strengths of each to provide a seamless experience.

Zupass is now securely stored on-chain, enabling the generation of ZK passes from on-chain data, eliminating the need for external databases and enhancing user privacy.

Our project is a friendly zero-knowledge (zk) ticketing system that's part of the DevConnect login framework. We create tickets on the blockchain, ensuring each ticket is secure and verifiable across different chains, which we affectionately refer to as our "frens". 

In addition to our core functionality, we've included a fun feature that searches for frogs in the swamp. We're also deeply integrated with the Lens Protocol, allowing ticket holders to prove their identity through their decentralized social media profiles.

The construction of this project was akin to assembling a complex puzzle, with each piece representing a different technology. We've utilized zk-SNARKs for privacy and PCDs (Proof of Carrying Data) to validate tickets discreetly.

Our approach wasn't just to combine buzzwords; we've made these technologies work in harmony. By integrating with various blockchains and Layer 2 solutions, we've enabled ticket access and verification through PCDs and proofs.

The frog petter is a light-hearted addition we coded in for a bit of amusement. It's a reminder that while technology can be serious, there's always room for fun.

We've also developed a fully decentralized betting protocol on the Chiliz blockchain, which operates without a governance token. You can explore it at https://www.lenspass.xyz/#/bets.
This protocol allows validators to stake CHZ tokens to create and endorse bets in a trustless environment. The stakes are high: winners take the entire pot from the losing side, distributed proportionally.
To maintain fairness and deter malpractice, validators who act maliciously and are in the minority risk having their stake slashed. This mechanism aligns incentives and ensures the integrity of the betting process.
