      <p>
        Each Frog is a PCD (Proof Carrying Data), with attributes securely
        signed by Zupass, making them tamper-proof. They are end-to-end
        encrypted, meaning they cannot be recovered without your password,
        including by Zupass.
      </p>
      <p>
        By clicking Download, you will receive an unencrypted, plaintext copy of
        all your Frogs. Although this file contains minimal sensitive
        information, we recommend safeguarding it for privacy reasons. It can be
        used to recover your FrogPCDs in case you forget your password or
        encounter a glitch in the Zuniverse.
